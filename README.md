# beatmaker-X - Create music by typing it out in clear text
This is just a POC for fun, who knows, maybe could be something fun one day ;)

## About
This literally took 20 minutes from start to finish so don't expect too much

The asynchronous playback of sounds comes from STARTING ENTIRE PYTHON THREADS, genius right?

Would be a fun project to actually implement though to learn about programming sound. 
Maybe a terminal music program? Haha
